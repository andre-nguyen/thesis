# Autonomous Wind Turbine Inspections (AWTI)

This repository contains my written masters thesis about Autonomous Wind Turbine 
Inspections performed under Mitacs project IT08812 as a collaboration between
Polytechnique Montreal and Microdrones Canada Inc. As part of the agreement
all intellectual property belongs to Microdrones, as such the implementation of
this project is kept in a seperate repository.

## Project Scope

* **Knowing** that current wind turbine inspection methods involve two surveyors climbing up a turbine and rapelling down a blade to inspect it up close.
* **Knowing** that current methods can take anywhere between two and four hours to complete a full inspection.
* **Knowing** that current drone based inspections require at least two surveyors including a pilot and a camera operator.

The aim of this project is to automate the data collection process, to reduce the time required for an inspection and to reduce the need for multiple operators in the case of a manually piloted drone based inspection.
