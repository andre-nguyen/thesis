# Structural Inspections Using Mobile Robots

This repository contains my written masters thesis about Structural Inspections Using Mobile Robots
partially performed under Mitacs project IT08812 as a collaboration between
Polytechnique Montreal and Microdrones Canada Inc. As part of the agreement
all intellectual property pertaining to the wind turbine inspection project
belongs to Microdrones, as such the implementation of
this project is kept in a seperate repository.

## Project Definition

This thesis encompasses both UGV and UAV based inspections methods. The first
project was my participation in the journal article titled: *A Motion Planning Strategy for the Active Vision-Based Mapping of Ground-Level Structures*
The second project was my participation in the development of a system for autonomous
Wind turbine inspections with Microdrones.

## Wind Turbine Inspection Project Scope

* **Knowing** that current wind turbine inspection methods involve two surveyors climbing up a turbine and rapelling down a blade to inspect it up close.
* **Knowing** that current methods can take anywhere between two and four hours to complete a full inspection.
* **Knowing** that current drone based inspections require at least two surveyors including a pilot and a camera operator.

The aim of this project is to automate the data collection process, to reduce the time required for an inspection and to reduce the need for multiple operators in the case of a manually piloted drone based inspection.
