@inproceedings{Cieslewski2017,
abstract = {— Exploring and mapping previously unknown en-vironments while avoiding collisions with obstacles is a fun-damental task for autonomous robots. In scenarios where this needs to be done rapidly, multi-rotors are a good choice for the task, as they can cover ground at potentially very high velocities. Flying at high velocities, however, implies the ability to rapidly plan trajectories and to react to new information quickly. In this paper, we propose an extension to classical frontier-based exploration that facilitates exploration at high speeds. The extension consists of a reactive mode in which the multi-rotor rapidly selects a goal frontier from its field of view. The goal frontier is selected in a way that minimizes the change in velocity necessary to reach it. While this approach can increase the total path length, it significantly reduces the exploration time, since the multi-rotor can fly at consistently higher speeds.},

abstract = {Cracks on the surface of a wind turbine blade (WTB) can be a sign of current or future damage to the underlying structure depending on the severity of the cracks. We investigated a new method for automatically detecting surface cracks based on image processing techniques. The method was evaluated by varying crack parameters and our method parameters. Identifying and quantifying cracks as small as hair thickness is possible with this technique. Orientation of a crack did not affect the results. The effects of uneven background illumination (present in images captured on-tower) were significantly reduced by optimizing the threshold value for the Canny edge detection method. The accuracy of quantifying a crack was increased by processing an image with both the Sobel and Canny edge detection methods and then combining the results to reduce background noise.},

@article{Hepp2017,
abstract = {We introduce a new method that efficiently computes a set of rich viewpoints and trajectories for high-quality 3D reconstructions in outdoor environments. The input images of the reconstruction are taken with a commodity RGB camera which is mounted on an autonomously navigated quadcopter, and the obtained recordings are fed into a multi-view stereo reconstruction pipeline that produces high-quality results but is computationally expensive. Our goal is to automatically explore an unknown area, and obtain a complete 3D scan of a region of interest (e.g., a large building). In this process, the scan is constraint by the restricted flight time of quadcopters and the heavy compute costs of the subsequent 3D reconstruction -- i.e., only a small number of images can be recorded and processed. To this end, we introduce a novel optimization strategy that respects these constraints by maximizing the information gain from sparsely-sampled view points while limiting the total number of captured images. The core of this strategy is based on the concept of tri-state space classification, which is common in volumetric fusion approaches, and includes labels for unknown, free, and occupied space. Our optimization leverages a hierarchical and sparse volumetric data structure that takes advantage of the implicit representation, where its main objective is to convert unknown space into known regions. In addition to the surface geometry, we utilize the free-space information to avoid obstacles and determine feasible flight paths. A simple tool can be used to specify the region of interest and to plan trajectories. We demonstrate our method by obtaining a number of compelling 3D reconstructions, and provide a thorough quantitative evaluation for our optimization strategy.},

The system estimates the relative position and distance between the UAV and the wind turbine, as well as the position of its blades, in order to support the initial phase of autonomous inspection before the UAV start to move along the blades to acquire pictures. The key algorithms used are Hough transform for detection of the wind turbine tower, hub and blades, as well as the Kalman filter for tracking. Experimental data acquired by a UAV at a wind park is used to evaluate the accuracy and robustness of recognition and navigation. It is found that under the tested conditions, the method gives sufficient accuracy for the task and can execute in real time on a single board computer in the UAV.},

The word navigare itself is derived from navis, which stands for `ship', and agere, meaning `to drive' (Esmat Sep 2007). Early navigation primarily dealt with vessels traveling in sea. However, it has now permeated into every imaginable form of transportation as well as various other applications including location-based services, search and rescue, law enforcement, road and air travel, remote asset tracking, fleet management, intelligence gathering, sports, public safety, and environmental assessment and planning (El-Rabbany 2002). Advances in microelectronics and miniaturization of integrated circuits have facilitated the production of inexpensive inertial sensors, global positioning system (GPS) receivers and powerful computers. This has placed navigation systems within easy reach of low cost applications.},

abstract = {This report addresses autonomous inspection of wind blades using a UAV by proposing to use computer vision combined with structured light to accurately segment and detect the wind blade edges. It will be proven that this method is invariant to both rotation and scale, while it is computationally efficient for use on real-time applications. The blade edges will be de- tected according to the segmented area of the blade, and identified as Hough transformed lines to easily develop a manouvering scheme which intends to follow the blade edges from root to tip, while maximizing the view of the blade without loosing view of the respective edges. It will also be shown that the method detects the blade tip, regardless of rotation and scale. Furthermore, the structured light will be utilized to efficiently compute feature point matches from a stereo vision system. These matches will be used to conduct 3D reconstruction of the re- spective feature points using 2D triangulation. This will enable transformation of coordinates between the image frame and camera frame, including a real-time estimate of the distance be- tween the blade and drone.

  abstract =	 {Programs using floating-point arithmetic are prone to accuracy problems caused by rounding and catastrophic cancellation. These phenomena provoke bugs that are notoriously hard to track down: the program does not necessarily crash and the results are not necessarily obviously wrong, but often subtly inaccurate. Further use of these values can lead to catastrophic errors. In this paper, we present a dynamic program analysis that supports the programmer in finding accuracy problems. Our analysis uses binary translation to perform every floating-point computation side by side in higher precision. Furthermore, we use a lightweight slicing approach to track the evolution of errors.  We evaluate our analysis by demonstrating that it catches wellknown floating-point accuracy problems and by analyzing the Spec CFP2006 floating-point benchmark. In the latter, we show how our tool tracks down a catastrophic cancellation that causes a complete loss of accuracy leading to a meaningless program result. Finally, we apply our program to a complex, real-world bioinformatics application in which our program detected a serious cancellation. Correcting the instability led not only to improved quality of the result, but also to an improvement of the program's run time.},

In experiments, our analyser is consistently more precise than a state-of-the-art static analyser and significantly outperforms floating-point decision procedures.},

  abstract =	 {An idea of the use of two accumulators for improvement of the precision of floating-point computations with graphic processing units (GPUs) is presented in this paper for applications in digital signal processing.  The increase of the precision of computations does not need any increase of the length of the data words. This is particularly important if hardware limits for the precision of computations exist, which is just the case for graphic processors. A history of development of the cores of graphic cards is analyzed together with the idea of general purpose computing using GPU's (GPGPU). Special attention has been paid to efficiency and precision of computations. The so-called maximum accuracy property has been analyzed and technically realized with no additional costs in hardware and computation time. The proposed approach has been tested with illustrative frequency modulated sine waveform generators.},

  abstract =	 {High confidence in floating-point programs requires proving numerical properties of final and intermediate values. One may need to guarantee that a value stays within some range, or that the error relative to some ideal value is well bounded. This certification may require a time-consuming proof for each line of code, and it is usually broken by the smallest change to the code, e.g., for maintenance or optimization purpose. Certifying floating-point programs by hand is, therefore, very tedious and error-prone. The Gappa proof assistant is designed to make this task both easier and more secure, due to the following novel features: It automates the evaluation and propagation of rounding errors using interval arithmetic. Its input format is very close to the actual code to validate. It can be used incrementally to prove complex mathematical properties pertaining to the code. It generates a formal proof of the results, which can be checked independently by a lower level proof assistant like Coq. Yet it does not require any specific knowledge about automatic theorem proving, and thus, is accessible to a wide community. This paper demonstrates the practical use of this tool for a widely used class of floating-point programs: implementations of elementary functions in a mathematical library.},

Almost every language has a floating-point datatype; computers from PCs to supercomputers have floating-point accelerators; most compilers will be called upon to compile floating-point algorithms from time to time; and virtually every operating system must respond to floating-point exceptions such as overflow. This paper presents a tutorial on those aspects of floating-point that have a direct impact on designers of computer systems. It begins with background on floating-point representation and rounding error, continues with a discussion of the IEEE floating-point standard, and concludes with numerous examples of how computer builders can better support floating-point.},

  abstract =	 {Computers manipulate approximations of real numbers, called floating-point numbers. The calculations they make are accurate enough for most applications. Unfortunately, in some (catastrophic) situations, the floating-point operations lose so much precision that they quickly become irrelevant. In this article, we review some of the problems one can encounter, focussing on the IEEE754-1985 norm. We give a (sketch of a) semantics of its basic operations then abstract them (in the sense of abstract interpretation) to extract information about the possible loss of precision. The expected application is abstract debugging of software ranging from simple on-board systems (which use more and,more on-the-shelf micro-processors with floating-point units) to scientific codes. The abstract analysis is demonstrated on simple examples and compared with related work},

We present a complete survey of a static analysis based on abstract interpretation, and a prototype implementing this analysis for C code, for studying the propagation of rounding errors occurring at every intermediary step in floating-point computations.  In the first part of this paper, we briefly present the domains and techniques used in the implemented analyzer, called FLUCTUAT. We describe in the second part, the experiments made on real industrial codes, at Institut de Radioprotection et de Su&circ;rete&acute; Nucle&acute;aire and at Hispano-Suiza, respectively coming from the nuclear industry and from aeronautics industry. This paper aims at filling in the gaps between some theoretical aspects of the static analysis of floating-point computations that have been described in [13,14,21], and the necessary choices of algorithms and implementation, in accordance with practical motivations drawn from real industrial cases.},
