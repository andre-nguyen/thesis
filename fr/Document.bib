@inproceedings{Cieslewski2017,
abstract = {— Exploring and mapping previously unknown en-vironments while avoiding collisions with obstacles is a fun-damental task for autonomous robots. In scenarios where this needs to be done rapidly, multi-rotors are a good choice for the task, as they can cover ground at potentially very high velocities. Flying at high velocities, however, implies the ability to rapidly plan trajectories and to react to new information quickly. In this paper, we propose an extension to classical frontier-based exploration that facilitates exploration at high speeds. The extension consists of a reactive mode in which the multi-rotor rapidly selects a goal frontier from its field of view. The goal frontier is selected in a way that minimizes the change in velocity necessary to reach it. While this approach can increase the total path length, it significantly reduces the exploration time, since the multi-rotor can fly at consistently higher speeds.},

@article{Zhang2014,
abstract = {Cracks on the surface of a wind turbine blade (WTB) can be a sign of current or future damage to the underlying structure depending on the severity of the cracks. We investigated a new method for automatically detecting surface cracks based on image processing techniques. The method was evaluated by varying crack parameters and our method parameters. Identifying and quantifying cracks as small as hair thickness is possible with this technique. Orientation of a crack did not affect the results. The effects of uneven background illumination (present in images captured on-tower) were significantly reduced by optimizing the threshold value for the Canny edge detection method. The accuracy of quantifying a crack was increased by processing an image with both the Sobel and Canny edge detection methods and then combining the results to reduce background noise.},

@article{Hepp2017,
abstract = {We introduce a new method that efficiently computes a set of rich viewpoints and trajectories for high-quality 3D reconstructions in outdoor environments. The input images of the reconstruction are taken with a commodity RGB camera which is mounted on an autonomously navigated quadcopter, and the obtained recordings are fed into a multi-view stereo reconstruction pipeline that produces high-quality results but is computationally expensive. Our goal is to automatically explore an unknown area, and obtain a complete 3D scan of a region of interest (e.g., a large building). In this process, the scan is constraint by the restricted flight time of quadcopters and the heavy compute costs of the subsequent 3D reconstruction -- i.e., only a small number of images can be recorded and processed. To this end, we introduce a novel optimization strategy that respects these constraints by maximizing the information gain from sparsely-sampled view points while limiting the total number of captured images. The core of this strategy is based on the concept of tri-state space classification, which is common in volumetric fusion approaches, and includes labels for unknown, free, and occupied space. Our optimization leverages a hierarchical and sparse volumetric data structure that takes advantage of the implicit representation, where its main objective is to convert unknown space into known regions. In addition to the surface geometry, we utilize the free-space information to avoid obstacles and determine feasible flight paths. A simple tool can be used to specify the region of interest and to plan trajectories. We demonstrate our method by obtaining a number of compelling 3D reconstructions, and provide a thorough quantitative evaluation for our optimization strategy.},

abstract = {The word `navigation' comes from Latin navigare which means `to sail'. The word navigare itself is derived from navis, which stands for `ship', and agere, meaning `to drive' (Esmat Sep 2007). Early navigation primarily dealt with vessels traveling in sea. However, it has now permeated into every imaginable form of transportation as well as various other applications including location-based services, search and rescue, law enforcement, road and air travel, remote asset tracking, fleet management, intelligence gathering, sports, public safety, and environmental assessment and planning (El-Rabbany 2002). Advances in microelectronics and miniaturization of integrated circuits have facilitated the production of inexpensive inertial sensors, global positioning system (GPS) receivers and powerful computers. This has placed navigation systems within easy reach of low cost applications.},

By assuming invertibility of certain matrices, the Kalman filtering ``prediction-correction'' algorithm will be derived based on the optimality criterion of least-squares unbiased estimation of the state vector with the optimal weight, using all available data information. The filtering algorithm is first obtained for a system with no deterministic (control) input. By superimposing the deterministic solution, we then arrive at the general Kalman filtering algorithm.",

abstract = {Micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) are an exciting technology for mobile sensing of infrastructure as they can easily position sensors in to hard to reach positions. Although MAVs equipped with 3D sensing are starting to be used in industry, they currently must be remotely controlled by a skilled pilot. In this paper we present an exploration path planning approach for MAVs equipped with 3D range sensors like lidar. The only user input that our approach requires is a 3D bounding box around the structure. Our method incrementally plans a path for a MAV to scan all surfaces of the structure up to a resolution and detects when exploration is finished. We demonstrate our method by modeling a train bridge and show that our method builds 3D models with the efficiency of a skilled pilot.},

@article{Hert1996,
abstract = {An efficient, on-line terrain-covering algorithm is presented for a robot (AUV) moving in an unknown three-dimensional underwater environment. Such an algorithm is necessary for producing mosaicked images of the ocean floor. The basis of this three-dimensional motion planning algorithm is a new planar algorithm for nonsimply connected areas with boundaries of arbitrary shape. We show that this algorithm generalizes naturally to complex three-dimensional environments in which the terrain to be covered is projectively planar. This planar algorithm represents an improvement over previous algorithms because it results in a shorter path length for the robot and does not assume a polygonal environment. The path length of our algorithm is shown to be linear in the size of the area to be covered; the amount of memory required by the robot to implement the algorithm is linear in the size of the description of the boundary of the area. An example is provided that demonstrates the algorithm's per...},

@article{Acar2002,
abstract = {The goal of coverage path planning is to determine a path that passes a detector over all points in an environment. This work prescribes a provably complete coverage path planner for robots in unknown spaces. We achieve coverage using Morse decompositions which are exact cellular decompositions whose cells are defined in terms of critical points of Morse functions. Generically, two critical points define a cell. We encode the topology of the Morse decomposition using a graph that has nodes corresponding to the critical points and edges representing the cells defined by pairs of critical points. The robot simultaneously covers the space while incrementally constructing this graph. To achieve this, the robot must sense all the critical points. Therefore, we first introduce a critical point sensing method that uses range sensors. Then we present a provably complete algorithm which guarantees that the robot will encounter all the critical points, thereby constructing the full graph, i.e., achieving complete c...},
