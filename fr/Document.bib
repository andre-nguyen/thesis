@inproceedings{Cieslewski2017,
abstract = {— Exploring and mapping previously unknown en-vironments while avoiding collisions with obstacles is a fun-damental task for autonomous robots. In scenarios where this needs to be done rapidly, multi-rotors are a good choice for the task, as they can cover ground at potentially very high velocities. Flying at high velocities, however, implies the ability to rapidly plan trajectories and to react to new information quickly. In this paper, we propose an extension to classical frontier-based exploration that facilitates exploration at high speeds. The extension consists of a reactive mode in which the multi-rotor rapidly selects a goal frontier from its field of view. The goal frontier is selected in a way that minimizes the change in velocity necessary to reach it. While this approach can increase the total path length, it significantly reduces the exploration time, since the multi-rotor can fly at consistently higher speeds.},

  abstract =	 {Programs using floating-point arithmetic are prone to accuracy problems caused by rounding and catastrophic cancellation. These phenomena provoke bugs that are notoriously hard to track down: the program does not necessarily crash and the results are not necessarily obviously wrong, but often subtly inaccurate. Further use of these values can lead to catastrophic errors. In this paper, we present a dynamic program analysis that supports the programmer in finding accuracy problems. Our analysis uses binary translation to perform every floating-point computation side by side in higher precision. Furthermore, we use a lightweight slicing approach to track the evolution of errors.  We evaluate our analysis by demonstrating that it catches wellknown floating-point accuracy problems and by analyzing the Spec CFP2006 floating-point benchmark. In the latter, we show how our tool tracks down a catastrophic cancellation that causes a complete loss of accuracy leading to a meaningless program result. Finally, we apply our program to a complex, real-world bioinformatics application in which our program detected a serious cancellation. Correcting the instability led not only to improved quality of the result, but also to an improvement of the program's run time.},

This is particularly important if hardware limits for the precision of computations exist, which is just the case for graphic processors. A history of development of the cores of graphic cards is analyzed together with the idea of general purpose computing using GPU's (GPGPU). Special attention has been paid to efficiency and precision of computations. The so-called maximum accuracy property has been analyzed and technically realized with no additional costs in hardware and computation time. The proposed approach has been tested with illustrative frequency modulated sine waveform generators.},

  abstract =	 {High confidence in floating-point programs requires proving numerical properties of final and intermediate values. One may need to guarantee that a value stays within some range, or that the error relative to some ideal value is well bounded. This certification may require a time-consuming proof for each line of code, and it is usually broken by the smallest change to the code, e.g., for maintenance or optimization purpose. Certifying floating-point programs by hand is, therefore, very tedious and error-prone. The Gappa proof assistant is designed to make this task both easier and more secure, due to the following novel features: It automates the evaluation and propagation of rounding errors using interval arithmetic. Its input format is very close to the actual code to validate. It can be used incrementally to prove complex mathematical properties pertaining to the code. It generates a formal proof of the results, which can be checked independently by a lower level proof assistant like Coq. Yet it does not require any specific knowledge about automatic theorem proving, and thus, is accessible to a wide community. This paper demonstrates the practical use of this tool for a widely used class of floating-point programs: implementations of elementary functions in a mathematical library.},

This paper presents a tutorial on those aspects of floating-point that have a direct impact on designers of computer systems. It begins with background on floating-point representation and rounding error, continues with a discussion of the IEEE floating-point standard, and concludes with numerous examples of how computer builders can better support floating-point.},

We give a (sketch of a) semantics of its basic operations then abstract them (in the sense of abstract interpretation) to extract information about the possible loss of precision. The expected application is abstract debugging of software ranging from simple on-board systems (which use more and,more on-the-shelf micro-processors with floating-point units) to scientific codes. The abstract analysis is demonstrated on simple examples and compared with related work},
